## Usage

Use to make Sensitivity Analysis on networks, single/multiparameter, and receive a report with the results. You can configure multiple 'experiments' to organize your work and test new ideias.

You can also automatically export the Sensitivity Analysis results to a Genetic Algorithm in-built to calibrate your network, or configure by yourself the calibration module.
