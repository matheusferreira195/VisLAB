# Vistools

This GUI application is design to help analysts model and calibrate traffic on a fast, reliable and organized manner.
It's a work in progress, but the final product will be a .exe, and made on Python 3.6 with Tkinter for the GUI programming.

## Usage

Use to make Sensitivity Analysis on networks, single/multiparameter, and receive a report with the results. You can configure multiple 'experiments' to organize your work and test new ideias.

You can also automatically export the Sensitivity Analysis results to a Genetic Algorithm in-built to calibrate your network, or configure by yourself the calibration module.

## Installation
You need to have `Python 3.6x`, with the following modules:
- Pandas;
- Win32com;
- Tkinter;
- Numpy.

Soon I will add a guide about how to install these modules, but you can look for `pip install (module name)`.
